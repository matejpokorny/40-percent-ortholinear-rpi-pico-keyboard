# 3D printed 40 percent ortholinear raspberry pi pico based mechanical keyboard

## Features

## You will need

- 3D printer
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- 47 Cherry MX compatible switches
- Optional - 1 Cherry MX compatible stabilizer (as the spacebar is only 2U size, it is not neccesary to have a stabilizer there)
- 47 keycaps (can be also printed if you want to)
- 47 1N4148 diodes
- some wire
- soldering iron
- a lot of patience

*Tip: if you are cheap like me, harvest most of the parts from a cheap second hand mechanical keyboard*

## Build

1. Print the base plate from `parts/base_plate`

2. Assemble all the switches and stabilizer to the base plate

*I had to modify the base plate with a knife and hot glue the stabilizers, I pushed an updated version of the model to this repo, so hopefully you will have an easier time assembling it.*
